Short and sweet:

```
npm install
npm run build-watch
npm start
```

`npm start` doesn't build, so watch out for that. The reason it doesn't build is because you
probably want to watch the build and run me in separate terminals. Otherwise, build errors get
all mixed in with HTTP request logging.

## My anatomy

`/app` has the React/Redux setup. `main.jsx` is the entry point.

`/db` has the Sequelize models and database setup. It'll create the database for you if it doesn't exist,
assuming you're using postgres.

`/server` has the Express server and routes. `start.js` is the entry point.

`/bin` has scripts. (Right now it has *one* script that creates a useful symlink.)

## Conventions

I use `require` and `module.exports` in `.js` files.

I use `import` and `export` in `.jsx` files, unless `require` makes for cleaner code.

I use two spaces, no semi-colons, and trailing commas where possible. I'll
have a linter someday soon.

## Quick Heroku deployment

1. Set up the Heroku command line tools
2. `heroku login`
3. Add a git remote for heroku:
  - **If you're creating a new app...**
    1. `heroku create` or `heroku create your-app-name` if you have a name in mind.
    2. `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` to add postgres
    3. `npm run deploy-heroku`. This will create a new branch and compile and commit your
       frontend JS to it, then push that branch to Heroku.
    4. `heroku run db/seed` to seed the database

  - **If you already have a Heroku app...**
    1.  `heroku git:remote your-app-name` You'll need to be a collaborator on the app.

Afterwards,
  - *To deploy:* `npm run deploy-heroku`
  - *To re-seed:* `npm run db/seed`
